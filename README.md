# Fibonacci-modified
Complete the fibonacciModified function in the editor below. It must return the  number in the sequence.

fibonacciModified has the following parameter(s):

t1: an integer
t2: an integer
n: an integer
Note: The value of  may far exceed the range of a -bit integer. Many submission languages have libraries that can handle such large results but, for those that don't (e.g., C++), you will need to compensate for the size of the result.
